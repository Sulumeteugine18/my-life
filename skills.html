        <p1>Growing up, i liked playing football. I have been playing football ever since i was eight years old. Even though i never made it proffesionally, it has always been what i liked doing. Also when growing up, i developed an interest in art. I loved drawing sketches and images of things i liked. Now as an IT student, i also have a passion for coding and programming.</p1>
